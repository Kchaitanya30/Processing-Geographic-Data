# Geoprocessing Techniques Assignment 2

In this assignment I will be working on several geo-processing techniques to prepare geographic data for analytical use. A primary objective is to think about geo-processing from a methodological perspective and plan out a systematic process, selecting the proper tools to efficiently prepare data, minimize errors, and produce a quality product for use by others. Multiple geographies will be integrated together, forming new geometries for the purpose of calculating geographic information on distinct land types, which are the urbanized and non-urbanized areas in each township.

Work will be done with 
- layer attribute tables, requiring field calculations, joins, and transfers of data between multiple attribute tables.
- Combine multiple layers into a single layer so that additional data can be obtained based on geography type, allowing for more robust and specific statistics to be calculated. 
- Additionally, these tasks also demonstrate
how to geo-process layers using geographic attributes.

## Background
A primary objective of GIS database management in many organizations is to provide geographic data for use by staff or the public. Preparing data for use by others is a laborious task that requires using a systematic process (method) that strings a series of tools (techniques) together to reduce error and standardize data. In preparing data for use by others, both the attribute and geometric data of a geography need to be cleaned and prepared before being made available for use. Not processing data to reduce error and standardizing the geographies (geometry) to make them consistent leads to incorrect analyses that can range from minimal to severe. Geo-processing is the preparation and cleaning of geographic data, including attributes with those data, There are four general stages of geographic data management, which are 
(i) Data Collections, Input, & Correction, 
(ii) Storage & Retrieval, 
(iii) Manipulation & Analysis,
(iv) Output & Reporting (Martin, 1995). 

Geo-processing can occur in any of these stages, but data preparation and cleaning for use by others primarily occurs in
first stage. In this first stage data are collected by either creating the data or obtaining copies of data from other sources, both of which are for meeting the objectives of the
organization in using that data. These stages need not be linear in one direction, but iterative in which data are improved or extended for additional needs at any stages.

### Orginal Data used
mass_townships_2010_aeac84
Source: Massachusetts Traffic Records Analysis Center(MassTRAC)
Description: This is the township layer for Massachusetts
Number of features: 351
new_england_urbanized_areas_2010_aeac84
Source: Massachusetts Traffic Records Analysis Center(MassTRAC)
Description: This is the polygon showing the urbanized areas in the Massachusetts
Number of features: 21


## Step by Step Process
- Download the data for the assignment and save it a new folder 
- The data is in gdb(geodatabase) format, Create copy of it and rename as sandbox, It is very important to create a sandbox and production geodabase so that original data will be safe.

- In this assignment we will be working on collision data in massachusets, where initially township layer is divided to urbanized and unurbanized so that collision analysis can be done for both the areas. the following steps are done

- Overlay the township and unurbanized layers, the below figure shows how different they are

## Integrate the New England Urbanized Area layer into the Massachusetts Township layer with a spatial overlay tool.

### Identity
It is used integrate the Urbanized Area layer (identity) into the Massachusetts Township layer (input). In terms of geo-processing, integration mean combining two different geographies (layers) into one, splitting the polygons of each geography where their geometries intersect. Doing so creates a new layer of both geographies, in which new polygons are created from splitting each where they overlap.
Input: mass_townships_2010_aeac84
Identify features: new_england_urbanized_areas_2010_aeac84
Attributes to join: All attributes ( It makes all attributes from input features as well as identity features will be transfered to the output layer )
Output layer: new_england_urbanized_areas_townships_2010_aeac84_idty

- It basically cut the townships layer and added the new england urbanized layer
- Now it has both the townships polygons and urbanized polygons

<img src="figures/townshipurbnidty.png" alt="Alt text" width="400"/>

- The output has the FID_new_england_urbanized_areas_2010_aeac84 
- It says whether the polygon we click isthe urbanized layer or it shows -1 if it is not linking to any of the polygon
-  -1 are the non urbanized areas and 
- Positive  values those are the urbanized areas( they are the OBJECTID_1 of the new_england_urbanized_areas_2010_aeac84 layer )

### New fields inthe new_england_urbanized_areas_townships_2010_aeac84_idty
Create two fields for identity layer, with one field being labeled AREA_URB and the other being AREA_NURB. These will hold the square kilometers for the urbanized and non-urbanized polygons, choose the type as Double as the area has decibel values

## After integrating the New England Urbanized Area layer into the Massachusetts Township layer, calculate the amount of area that is urbanized and non-urbanized area. Create two new fields that hold the amount of each area and calculate (transfer) the corresponding area into those new fields.

Populating the AREA_URBN and AREA_NURB

Task is to find how much area is urbanized and how is not urbanized

For AREA_NURB
Tool: Select by Attributes
Input Rows: new_england_urbanized_areas_townships_2010_aeac84_idty
Where: FID_new_england_urbanized_areas_2010_aeac84    is equal to -1

Right click on the AREA_NURB > Calculate field
Input Table: new_england_urbanized_areas_townships_2010_aeac84_idty
* Use the selected records: 309 ( it shows how many rows got selected )
* field name: AREA_NURB
* Expression: AREA_NUMB = !shape_Area!
* It populated the AREA_NURB with Shape_area values

Till now -1 values of the field FID_new_england_urbanized_areas_2010_aeac84 are selected, the trick is to select **Switch** button. It selects all the values that are not -1.
- This step is useful to minimize select by attributes step.
- ALl the values that are not -1 are selected, which represents the urbanized areas

Right click on the AREA_URB > Calculate field
Input Table: new_england_urbanized_areas_townships_2010_aeac84_idty
* Use the selected records: 340 ( it shows how many rows got selected )
* field name: AREA_URB
* Expression: AREA_URB = !shape_Area!
* It populated the AREA_URB with Shape_area values

- We have populated the shape areas to both AREA_NUMB and AREA_URB, it left with nulls which needs to be taken care of
- Nulls make create issue while doing any numerical analysis, they have to be changed to 0

Tool: Select by Attributes
Input Rows: new_england_urbanized_areas_townships_2010_aeac84_idty
Where: AREA_URB  **is null**
- It selects the rows with null values

Right click on the AREA_URB > Calculate field
Input Table: new_england_urbanized_areas_townships_2010_aeac84_idty
* Use the selected records: 309 ( it shows how many rows got selected )
* field name: AREA_URB
* Expression: AREA_URB = 0
- It fills all the rows with nulls to 0 in the AREA_URB field

* Repeat the same for AREA_NURB

- Now we have create two new fields AREA_URB and AREA_NURB and filled them with the shape areas and recoded the nulls to 0.
