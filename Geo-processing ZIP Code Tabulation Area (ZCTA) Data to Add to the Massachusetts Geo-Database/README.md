Objective: For this assignment a Methodological approach is followed which means the data being processed in a structured, systematic way that follwos plan andpurpose for collecting, cleaning, structuring and transforming data to ensure accuracy and reliability for analysis. Multiple geographies are integrated together, forming new geometries for the purspose of calculating geographic inforamtion on distinct land types, which are the urbanized and non-urbanized areas within a larger geography. Key operations performed are spatial ovelays, joins, usage of field calculator, transfer data between attribute tables.

## Tasks
Complete the geo-processing of the Massachusetts ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) layer that was geometrically matched to the Township layer. The geo- processing of this single layer uses several tools and follows the method demonstrated in class. The final results with be a production ready ZCTA layer that contains the 
(i) urbanized & non-urbanized areas, 
(ii) five collision group counts, 
(iii) and road lengths, with each of ii and iii be by urbanized and non-urbanized area


## Part I: Integrating Geographies and Calculating Area Types

### Geo-Process the ZCTA layer match the Massachusetts Township Layer
